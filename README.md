# SAM Masking with Rainbow Patterns

This project demonstrates how to use the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for image segmentation and apply custom rainbow patterns to segmented regions. 

## Overview

This repository provides a Python script that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automatically generate masks for a given image. The script allows you to interactively select a region of interest and apply a wavy rainbow pattern to the selected mask.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `torch`, `opencv-python`, `PIL`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `segment_anything`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch opencv-python pillow numpy matplotlib
```

You also need to install the `segment_anything` package. If it's not available on PyPI, you might need to clone it from the source or install it from a local path.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sam-masking-rainbow-patterns.git
   cd sam-masking-rainbow-patterns
   ```

2. **Download the SAM Model Checkpoint:**
   
   - Download the model checkpoint file `sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth` and place it in the `/content/` directory or update the path in the script accordingly.

3. **Prepare Your Image:**

   - Place your input image in the `/content/` directory and update the `image_path` in the script.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Python. Make sure you have the SAM model checkpoint and your image in the appropriate directories.

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Interactively Select a Mask Region:**

   - The script will display the image and allow you to click and select a rectangular region of interest.
   - After selecting a region, the script will apply a rainbow wavy pattern to the selected mask.

## Example

Here is an example of the process:

1. **Original Image:**

   ![Original Image](images/original_image.jpg)

2. **Selected Mask Region:**

   ![Selected Mask](images/selected_mask.jpg)

3. **Processed Image with Rainbow Pattern:**

   ![Rainbow Pattern](images/processed_image_with_pattern.jpg)

## Code Overview

- **`show_mask` Function:** Displays the mask on the image with an optional color overlay.
- **`show_points` Function:** Plots the points used for mask prediction.
- **`show_box` Function:** Draws a bounding box around the selected region.
- **`create_rainbow_waves` Function:** Generates a rainbow wavy pattern.
- **`apply_pattern_to_mask` Function:** Applies the generated pattern to the selected mask region.

### Instructions to Add Images

1. **Save your images** (e.g., `original_image.jpg`, `selected_mask.jpg`, `processed_image_with_pattern.jpg`) in a directory called `images` within your repository.

2. **Update the Image Paths** in the `README.md` file according to where you save the images.

3. **Push Changes** to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add README.md images/
   git commit -m "Add README with images"
   git push
   ```

Feel free to adjust the text and images as per your specific project and preferences.
